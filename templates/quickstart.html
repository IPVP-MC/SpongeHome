    <h1>Get yourself started with Sponge</h1>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Here's a short list of prerequisites you need to fulfill to be able to run a server with Sponge:
    <ul>
      <li>Java 8 Update 42+ (64bit recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sponge has been built from the ground up to enrich your Minecraft experience by allowing plugins to add
        functionality to Minecraft.
        Most plugins developed with the Sponge API should work across several different versions of Minecraft
        without needing to be updated.
