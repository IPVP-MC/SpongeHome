  <h1>Get yourself started with Sponge</h1>
  <p>
      The purpose of the Sponge project is to create a plugin development framework for Minecraft.
      Sponge is being created by a global community, and its open-source nature means anyone can participate.
  </p>
  <p>
      Sponge has been built from the ground up to enrich your Minecraft experience by allowing plugins to add
      functionality to Minecraft.
  </p>
  <p>
      Most plugins developed with the Sponge API should work across several different versions of Minecraft
      without needing to be updated.
